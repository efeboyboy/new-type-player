# The String Patch for Buchla Series 200

## Patch Description

This `.mdc` document outlines the **String Patch** for the **Buchla Series 200** modular synthesizer system. This patch is designed to produce rich, string-like tones that convey a distinct impression of **bowing**. It serves as an example of a self-playing patch where the system generates evolving textures without constant manual intervention.

## Concept and Functionality

**(Diagram 4, Tape Example 1)**

This patch produces extremely rich, resonant string-like sounds, mimicking the organic motion of bowing. The result is an intricate, evolving texture that gives the impression that the patch is "playing itself."

### AFG and Oscillator Interaction

- Two AFG outputs work in tandem, set at either **unison** or **octave** intervals.
- The AFGs are strobed simultaneously by a **rapid pulse** from the **Sequencer**.
- An external control voltage shifts **very slowly** during playback, subtly altering pitch over time.

### Sloped Function and Frequency Separation

The **sloped** function of the AFGs operates at slightly different rates in **AFG 1** and **AFG 2**. With every movement (left or right), the two oscillatorsâ€™ frequencies begin to diverge:

- This gradual separation causes the **Frequency Shifter** to detect two signals that are momentarily out of integral relationship.
- The result is a **timbral** or **bowing inflection**, generating a sound that mimics the natural movement of a bowed string instrument.

## Performance Use

In performance, the overall pitch range of the "strings" can be adjusted dynamically. The patch responds well across various ranges, from **bass** to **violin**, allowing performers to explore a wide sonic spectrum.

## Diagram 4: Detailed Patch Configuration

This diagram illustrates the technical structure of the patch:

- **Oscillator Inputs:**
  - **Oscillator 1 & 2 Frequency Inputs:** Produce harmonic intervals through controlled voltage inputs.
  
- **AFG Configuration:**
  - **Sloped Function:** Enables gradual pitch shifts between oscillators.
  - **Continuous and Limited Modes:** Adjust the extent of voltage changes.

- **Frequency Shifter 285:** Responds to small pitch deviations to create subtle timbral shifts.

- **Gate 292:** Controls the opening and closing of audio signals.
  
- **Combo Filter 291:** Shapes the harmonic content of the output sound.

- **Random Voltage Modulation:**
  - From the **265 Source of Uncertainty**, producing a continuous random voltage at a rate set between **0.5 Hz** and **0.05 Hz**.

- **Pulse Input:** Triggered by the **Sequencer** at approximately **0.05 Hz**, activating the bowing motion effect.

## Patch Configuration Details

- **Voltage Sliders:** Adjust within a limited, delicate range to retain string-like qualities.
- **Random Voltage Source Settings:** Set between **0.5 Hz** and **0.05 Hz** to control the rate of change.
- **Stage Advance:** Controlled by rapid sequencer pulses for synchronized strobing of oscillators.

---

## Technical Highlights

- **Simultaneous Strobing:** The two AFGs are activated simultaneously, producing synchronized changes.
- **Adjacent Stage Movements:** Each change moves to an adjacent stage (left or right), creating natural oscillation and frequency separation.
- **Frequency Shifter Reactions:** When the oscillators' frequencies separate, the **Frequency Shifter** introduces non-harmonic elements, adding depth and texture.
