## Melodic-Rhythmic Reliefs (or "Prism Melody")

This patch begins with a simple sequence of 16 ordered pitches. However, constant shifts in emphasis create an **aural illusion** that conceals this simplicity. The rhythmic base is established with a continuous pulse, and larger rhythmic structures emerge through:

- **Timbral Emphasis**
- **Registral Displacement**
- **Spatial Variation**

Although conceptually related to **serialism**, this technique evolved naturally from the interaction between the **Arbitrary Function Generator (AFG)** and the **Sequencer**.

### AFG and Sequencer Configuration

- **AFG Output 1 (Oscillator 1):**
  - Set on **External Row A (alternate)** at **+0 range**.
  - A **spatial rhythm** effect is achieved by routing the pulse output of the **Sequencer 246** to the **265 Stored Random Voltage Source**, then through the **Spatial Director 227**.
  - A more structured rhythm can be applied using a **264 Sample and Hold** paired with a smaller sequencer (*see Diagram 5*).

- **AFG Output 2 (Oscillator 2):**
  - Triggered by the sequencer pulse.
  - Driven by external control voltage from the **265 Source of Uncertainty**, causing each pulse to advance to a new AFG stage.
  - Activating **strobe mode** frees the **"Interval Time"** output for additional functions like **waveshape modulation**.

### Pitch and Rhythm Variations

- All voltage sliders (except the first) are set on **External Row B**.
- Regardless of the AFG stage triggered, the output corresponds to the next pitch in **Sequencer Row B**.
- Individual programming of each stage allows adjustments for:
  - **Octave Transposition**
  - **Waveshape Modulation**
  - **Output Pulse Variation**

This setup produces a layered effect, where multiple melodic lines appear to evolve simultaneously, each with its own rhythm and continuity.

## Diagram 2: Detailed Signal Path and Stage Configuration

The diagram highlights the following functions:

- **Oscillator 1 & 2 Frequency Inputs:** Limited range switches to produce octave intervals.
- **Quantization Controls:** Enable stepped voltage outputs for pitch control.
- **Time Balance:** Allows waveshape control across all stages.
- **Strobe & External Inputs:** Activate the random voltage source from the **265 Source of Uncertainty** for stochastic modulation.
- **Sequencer Rows A-D:** Different rows control various pitch sequences.
- **Random Voltage & Pulse Outputs:** Modulate probabilities and rates, introducing chance elements into the performance.

## Musical Illustration: Rhythmic and Registral Variations

The musical score represents variations in both timbre and register. Two primary waveforms are used:

- **Sawtooth Wave (ùÖü)**
- **Sine Wave (ùÖü)**

**Notational Breakdown:**

- The top system presents a regular rhythmic sequence with slight variations in register and pitch.
- Subsequent systems introduce larger leaps and spatial displacement, creating the illusion of multiple simultaneous melodies.
- Registral shifts are combined with rhythmic gaps to enhance the feeling of layered polyphony.
