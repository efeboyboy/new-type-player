# The Vertical Sequencer Patch for Buchla Series 200

## Patch Description

This `.mdc` document details the **Vertical Sequencer** patch for the **Buchla Series 200** modular synthesizer system. This patch explores harmonic rhythm and melodic layering by using the interaction between the **Arbitrary Function Generator (AFG)** and the **Sequencer**.

In this patch, four pitches at each stage of the sequencer are arpeggiated by the AFG. As the AFG advances the sequencer through its stages, a regular harmonic rhythm and interwoven melodic texture are produced.

## The Vertical Sequencer: Concept and Functionality

This concept arises from the interaction between the **AFG** and the **Sequencer**. The **four pitches** at each sequencer stage are **arpeggiated** by the AFG, advancing the sequencer to its next stage and producing a **regular harmonic rhythm** combined with a rich **melodic texture**.

The external output voltage levels from the AFG are distributed across **Rows A, B, C, and D** at different octave levels.

---

### AFG and Sequencer Configuration

- A **series 2 pulse** is programmed at stage 16 of the AFG to **advance the Sequencer 246**.
- The **pulse "2" output** of AFG 1 is patched into the **advance input** of the sequencer.

### Pulse and Voice Separation

- **AFG 1** drives **AFG 2** from its **"all pulse" output**.
- Initially, both AFG outputs track the 16 sequencer stages **in unison**.
- Later, **AFG 2** is manually advanced to deviate from AFG 1, producing a **distinctly separate voice**.

### Melodic Texture Development

At each pass of the 16 stages:

- A different set of four pitches from Rows **A, B, C, and D** will play at various transpositions, creating a **harp-like melodic-harmonic texture**.

### User Customization

- Adjust **limited range switches** and **output voltage sliders** to different external positions.
- Manually advance the AFG 2 output to explore different melodic contours within the texture.

## Diagram 3: Detailed Sequencer Configuration

The diagram outlines:

- **Oscillator 1 & 2 Frequency Inputs:** Producing octaves through limited range switches.
- **Quantization:** Stepped voltage outputs for precise pitch control.
- **Time Balance:** Controls wave shape across all stages.
- **External Inputs:** Modulation from the **265 Source of Uncertainty**.
- **Sequencer Rows A-D:** Each row executes a unique melodic progression.
- **Advance Trigger:** The pulse output from AFG advances the sequencer through each stage.

## Musical Illustration: Melodic and Harmonic Structure

The musical score illustrates a complex melodic-harmonic structure with varying transpositions.

### Key Components:

- **Sequencer Stages (1-16):** Each stage corresponds to a specific set of pitches.
- **Range Settings:** Determines the pitch range for each stage.
- **Row Assignments:** Specifies the melodic line for each sequencer row.

**Score Breakdown:**

- The notation outlines sequential melodic layers interwoven across registers.
- Each stage introduces new rhythmic and harmonic elements.
- AFG output manipulation introduces evolving melodic contours.

**Notational Elements:**

- * refers to the number of the sequencer stage (1 â†’ 16).
- ** indicates the pattern obtained by advancing one output of the AFG by two stages.
