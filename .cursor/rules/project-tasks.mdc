 # Buchla Series 200 Web Application Tasks

## Project Overview
This project aims to recreate specific Buchla Series 200 patches in a web application, making complex modular synthesis accessible to non-musicians. Instead of providing a fully modular environment, we'll offer carefully designed templates based on documented patches.

## Core Objectives
- Create an intuitive, user-friendly interface for non-musicians
- Maintain the sonic character and complexity of the original patches
- Provide meaningful visual feedback and interaction
- Focus on musical exploration rather than technical complexity

## Task List

### 1. User Interface Design [  ]
- [ ] Design patch selection interface
- [ ] Create animated visualizations for each patch type
- [ ] Design intuitive controls for key parameters
- [ ] Implement responsive layout for different screen sizes
- [ ] Add visual tutorials and help system

### 2. Audio Engine Development [  ]
- [ ] Implement core Tone.js infrastructure
- [ ] Create base oscillator system with multiple waveforms
- [ ] Develop envelope generator system
- [ ] Implement spatial audio routing
- [ ] Add frequency shifting capabilities
- [ ] Create quantization system for pitch control

### 3. Patch Templates [  ]
#### String Patch [  ]
- [ ] Implement dual oscillator system with frequency shifting
- [ ] Create "bowing" simulation using envelope control
- [ ] Add spatial movement controls
- [ ] Design string-specific UI controls

#### Vertical Sequencer [  ]
- [ ] Create 16-stage sequencer system
- [ ] Implement four-voice arpeggiator
- [ ] Add harmonic rhythm controls
- [ ] Design sequencer-specific visualization

#### Prism Melody [  ]
- [ ] Implement 16-pitch sequence system
- [ ] Add timbral emphasis controls
- [ ] Create spatial variation system
- [ ] Design melody-specific visualization

#### Basic Performance Patch [  ]
- [ ] Implement basic voice architecture
- [ ] Add simple modulation controls
- [ ] Create performance-oriented interface
- [ ] Design beginner-friendly parameter controls

### 4. Visual Feedback System [  ]
- [ ] Create animated signal flow visualization
- [ ] Implement real-time parameter display
- [ ] Add spatial position visualization
- [ ] Design patch-specific animations

### 5. Preset System [  ]
- [ ] Create preset management system
- [ ] Design preset browser interface
- [ ] Implement preset save/load functionality
- [ ] Add preset sharing capabilities

### 6. Documentation [  ]
- [ ] Write user guide for each patch
- [ ] Create interactive tutorials
- [ ] Add context-sensitive help
- [ ] Include musical examples and suggestions

### 7. Testing and Optimization [  ]
- [ ] Perform cross-browser testing
- [ ] Optimize audio processing
- [ ] Test on different devices
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Implement performance improvements
