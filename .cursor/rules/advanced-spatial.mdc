# Advanced Spatial Rhythms with the 227 Spatial Director

## Description

This section introduces advanced spatial manipulation techniques using the **227 Spatial Director**, the **264 Sample and Hold**, and a **Sequencer**. This method creates discrete spatial rhythms by directing sound through specific X and Y voltage inputs. The technique can be applied across various patches (e.g., **Prism Melody** and **String Patch**) to enhance spatial dynamics and add rhythmic complexity.

## Concept and Functionality

This patch enables **discrete spatial placement** of sounds using **high-low (H/L) voltage combinations** along the X and Y axes. Each unique voltage combination corresponds to a different spatial location within a defined grid controlled by the **227 Spatial Director**.

### Spatial Grid Combinations

The four corners of the spatial field correspond to different voltage levels:


+-----------------------+
| (L, H)   |   (H, H)   |
|          |            |
|-----------------------|
| (L, L)   |   (H, L)   |
+-----------------------+


L = Low Voltage
H = High Voltage

This setup allows for discrete placement of sounds in a spatial environment, creating dynamic rhythmic patterns across four distinct positions.

## Patch Configuration

### Modules and Connections

#### 227 Spatial Director
- Controls spatial placement using X and Y voltage inputs.

#### 264 Sample and Hold
- Provides three-stage voltage outputs for spatial modulation
- Output 1 connects to the X voltage input of the 227 Spatial Director
- Output 3 connects to the Y voltage input of the 227 Spatial Director

#### Sequencer (12 stages)
- Provides pulse outputs and voltage levels for driving spatial changes
- Pulse output connects to the common input of the 264 Sample and Hold

#### Keyboard Pulse (Optional)
- Can externally drive the sequencer to synchronize spatial rhythms with melodic content

## Spatial Pattern Example

The following spatial movement sequence is created by combining outputs from the 264 Sample and Hold:

| Stage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----| 
| X/Y | (H,L) | (L,L) | (H,H) | (L,H) | (H,L) | (L,L) | (H,H) | (L,H) | (H,L) | (L,L) | (H,H) | (L,H) |

## Visual Breakdown of Spatial Movement

### X and Y Voltage Output
- The outputs from the Sample and Hold drive the X and Y positions within the spatial field

### Spatial Movement Sequence
- As each sequencer stage advances, sound shifts dynamically between different points in space

### New Spatial Rhythms
Achieved by changing:
- The number of sequencer stages
- The number of sample and hold stages
- External triggers from a keyboard pulse

## Practical Application

This spatial rhythm technique can be applied in various patches:

### Prism Melody
- Introduce spatial variations by routing sequencer pulses to spatial modulation inputs
- Enhance the perception of polyphony with evolving spatial patterns

### String Patch
- Use discrete spatial placement to emphasize different aspects of the evolving bowing textures
- Combine random voltage fluctuations with spatial shifts for more complex textures

### Vertical Sequencer
- Apply spatial motion synchronized with melodic transpositions for an immersive sound experience

### Keyboard Rotations
- Spatially distribute polyphonic voices to create a richer auditory landscape
- Combine spatial shifts with the illusion of multiple voices for enhanced rhythmic complexity
